Post By Email Links
===================

**Note:** Requires the [Post By Email](https://github.com/codebykat/wp-post-by-email) plugin.

Filters the post content after a post has been created via the [Post By Email](https://github.com/codebykat/wp-post-by-email) plugin.  
If the post content contains only a URL it wraps the URL in a link tag and assigns the 'link' [post format](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) to the post.

In case the post already has been assigned a post format the post is ignored.
