Create new posts with the 'link' post format by sending an email with a URL or link as the body.

== Description ==

**Note:** Requires the [Post By Email](http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-by-email/) plugin.

The plugin filters the post content after a post has been created via the [Post By Email](http://wordpress.org/plugins/post-by-email/) plugin.
If the post content contains only a URL it automatically assigns the 'link' [post format](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) to the post and wraps the URL in a link tag.
